# Sentiment Analysis with RNN, LSTM, and GRU

This project performs sentiment classification on raw tweets using RNN-based architectures, comparing the performance of:
- Vanilla RNN
- LSTM
- GRU

## 📊 Dataset
- **Sentiment140**: 1.6M tweets labeled as positive or negative.
- [Link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)

## 🧠 Models
- Implemented in Keras/TensorFlow (or PyTorch)
- Compared on accuracy, loss, training time

## 📁 Structure
- `notebooks/`: Contains all exploratory notebooks for each model
- `src/`: Modular Python files for preprocessing, training, and models
- `data/`: Raw and cleaned datasets

## 🔧 Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rnn-lstm-gru-sentiment-analysis.git
